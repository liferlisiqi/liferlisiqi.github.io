## 题干
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"    
Output: 3     
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.    
Example 2:   
   
Input: "bbbbb"   
Output: 1    
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.   
Example 3:    

Input: "pwwkew"     
Output: 3    
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.     

Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.       


## 题解1
 
```c++  
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) 
    {
        int len = s.size();
        unordered_set<char> sub;
        int maxlen = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while(i < len && j < len)
        {
            if(sub.find(s[i]) == sub.end())
            {
                sub.insert(s[i++]);
                maxlen = max(maxlen, i - j);
            }
            else
            {
                sub.erase(s[j++]);
            }
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
};
```
