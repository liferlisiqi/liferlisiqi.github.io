## 题干
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.   

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.    

Example:   
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]   
Output: 49

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxA = 0, l = 0, r = height.size() - 1;
        while(l < r)
        {
            int minH = min(height[l], height[r]);
            maxA = max(maxA, minH * (r - l));
            while(height[l] <= minH && l < r) l++;
            while(height[r] <= minH && l < r) r--;
        }
        return maxA;
    }
